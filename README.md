####Modern Minimalistic Window Manager (WIP, heavily based off of FrankenWM)


stripped down FrankenWM -> too many functions I didnt use\
many more need to be stripped out, and code needs to be cleaned up\


####Modern and minimalist approach\
heavy gaps\
simplified, fewer, and more logical keyboard shortcuts\
3 modes: Tile (master/slave), Equal, (and floating on a per window basis)\

Tiled windows are interacted with by the keyboard\
Floating windows are interacted with by the mouse (except using the keyboard to pop them out)\


####Added features\
####--------------\
maximum 3 windows per desktop -> if new window is opened, open on next (+1) desktop with 2 or less windows, and focus there\
function to switch between 2 main tiling modes\

(WIP) cant invert stack on equal mode. multiple horizontally maximized windows are ugly\
